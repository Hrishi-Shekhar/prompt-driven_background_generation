A macro photograph captures a large object or scene, while a microphoto takes a very small subject and enlarges it to fill the frame. A close-up is somewhere between these two extremes, focusing on a specific part of an object or scene that is relatively close to the camera. In this case, we are looking for a close-up of a microscope showing a small amount of water in a small pond. This could be achieved by using a telephoto lens and setting the focal distance to a very short range, such as 10cm or less. The resulting image would show the details of the water droplets and any other features that are visible at this magnification level.
